Looks like you've found it.. I'm not sure exactly what you just discovered, but at least you're here!

This is just my first blog post to figure everything about this site out. If all goes well there will be plenty more content in the near future.

But you want to know what you will see here in the future! So here's my best guess:

- Random things that are on my mind
- Cool `O(n)` algorithms
- Cool `other-time-complexity` algoithms

I wonder how accurate this will be in a few months.
